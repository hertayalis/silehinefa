Much of it, as the Mail has discovered this week, was blown in the final years of Lisa Marie’s tragically short life amid legal battles, foolhardy business decisions, not to mention almost unimaginably profligate spending.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Indeed, one former financial manager claimed she ‘overspent herself into destitution and went broke twice because of her spending’.</p><img id=i-573e879a994abb25 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/21/66803101-11659537-image-a-28_1674250241029.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="One former financial manager claimed she ‘overspent herself into destitution and went broke twice because of her spending’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>One former financial manager claimed she ‘overspent herself into destitution and went broke twice because of her spending’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The mother-of-three is believed to have owed more than a $1 million in unpaid tax bills at the time of her death. Legal documents, seen by the Mail, also suggest that she had just $95,266 in cash and $714,775 in stocks, bonds and other assets.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crucially, as we shall see, she had previously sold off 85 per cent of her stake in ‘Elvis Presley Enterprises’ (EPE) built up for her by Priscilla — including rights to her father’s intellectual property, his image, his likeness and the right to operate Graceland as a tourist attraction.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The decision to relinquish control of the estate which controlled her father’s legacy was taken, in 2005, to get her out of one of the many financial crises which dogged her life. She continued to receive $100,000 a month from her remaining 15 per cent stake, along with a $4,361-a-month salary as an ‘employee’ of Graceland. But those amounts barely covered her outgoings which, she declared in court in 2018, were £92,000 a month — including $23,500 for rent and $1,708 for payments on her car, a Maserati.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Amid the financial mess she has left behind, a once unthinkable question is now being asked.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Will Elvis’s beloved Graceland have be to sold to pay off the mountainous debts his daughter has left behind? Or will Priscilla once again step into the breach, this time to advise her three granddaughters how best to protect their own financial futures, while preserving the Elvis legacy for years to come?</p><img id=i-63161c27bcfb0aa5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/20/66802023-11659537-image-a-13_1674248146337.jpg height=587 width=634 alt="Two years after the tragic death of her husband, Priscilla Presley was summoned to the office of Elvis’s accountant and warned that, without drastic action, the vast fortune he had left their only child would soon be lost along with his beloved home, Graceland" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Two years after the tragic death of her husband, Priscilla Presley was summoned to the office of Elvis’s accountant and warned that, without drastic action, the vast fortune he had left their only child would soon be lost along with his beloved home, Graceland</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Right now there are a lot of unknowns because we don’t know the full extent of Lisa Marie’s creditors,’ says Dallas attorney Ryan Sellers, whose company Hales and Sellers specialises in estate planning and probate.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s going to be a process where anybody who is owed money will come forward,’ he adds. ‘Does the estate have enough to cover those debts — or to come to some arrangement about the debts without having to sell a tangible asset?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The granddaughters are 33-year-old actress Riley, Lisa Marie’s eldest daughter from her first marriage to Danny Keough, as well as 14-year-old twins, Harper and Finley, from her fourth to musician Michael Lockwood. Her only son, Ben Keough, took his own life in July 2020 at the age of 27.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now motherless, her children will undoubtedly turn to the loving grandmother they know as ‘Nona’ for support and guidance; for Priscilla Beaulieu Presley has, without a doubt, been the calm constant in all of their lives.</p><img id=i-aef1ad1244cb0dba src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/21/66802277-11659537-image-a-20_1674248520231.jpg height=410 width=634 alt="She continued to receive $100,000 a month from her remaining 15 per cent stake, along with a $4,361-a-month salary as an ‘employee’ of Graceland" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>She continued to receive $100,000 a month from her remaining 15 per cent stake, along with a $4,361-a-month salary as an ‘employee’ of Graceland</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>What she advises them to do in the wake of their mother’s death remains to be seen.

But with more than 50 per cent of his earnings scythed off by his manager, ‘Colonel’ Tom Parker, Elvis squandered the remaining cash as fast as he earned it, splashing out on property and flashy cars, buying Cadillacs and other expensive gifts for staff at Graceland and for his friends and relatives.</p><img id=i-bc8f7055b5ecc01b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/20/66802009-11659537-image-a-3_1674247557256.jpg height=507 width=634 alt="Some estimates put the life-time earnings of the ‘King’ at a billion dollars" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Some estimates put the life-time earnings of the ‘King’ at a billion dollars</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As a child, Lisa Marie wanted for nothing in material terms. She had her own pony, a golf buggy to drive around her father’s Memphis estate, even a private jet named after her. Elvis famously once flew her in it to Utah so she could play in the snow for just 20 minutes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Notoriously hopeless with money, Elvis was worth just $5 million when he died — around $20 million by today’s standards. While his estate was generating around $1 million a year in 1979 when Priscilla took charge, the cost of running Graceland was $480,000 a year, most of it going on taxes, insurance and round-the-clock security for Elvis’s grave.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Most disastrously of all, the royalties from most of Presley’s recordings were not even going to his estate. In 1973, in a bid to clear debts that both he and Elvis had accumulated, Parker had sold the singer’s entire back catalogue up to that point to music giant RCA.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Both he and Elvis believed that they could rely, instead, on his income from touring — and future hits. Neither of them could have foreseen that within four years, the ‘King’ would be dead.</p><img id=i-84b403b1c0468154 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/20/66801965-11659537-image-a-2_1674247523240.jpg height=358 width=634 alt="As a child, Lisa Marie wanted for nothing in material terms.

She had her own pony, a golf buggy to drive around her father’s Memphis estate, even a private jet named after her</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When Priscilla took the helm in 1979, the Elvis estate was in dire straits, with an outstanding tax bill of £10 million.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Unable to access the rights to the hits her late ex-husband had sold off, she formed Elvis Presley Enterprises to exploit rights to his image with a global licensing programme, merchandising and TV and video projects along with royalties from songs recorded after the RCA deal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the heart of her business plan, of course, was Graceland, the eight-bedroom colonial-style home where Elvis lived and died in Memphis, which opened to the public in 1982 and was soon attracting 700,000 visitors a year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thanks to Priscilla’s hard work and stewardship, by the end of the 1980s Graceland was bringing in £15 million a year and, by the time Lisa Marie finally came into her father’s fortune in 1993, the estate was worth $100 million.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lisa Marie’s private life was already turbulent, with stints in rehab for alcohol and drug dependency. And it didn’t take long for her to undo her mother’s hard work.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When she took over a new trust set up to run the Elvis empire, she was already a mother-of-two — to Riley and Benjamin. A year later, in 1994, she divorced her first husband, Danny Keough, and, 20 days later, married troubled pop star Michael Jackson. In 2002 she married, and separated from, actor Nicholas Cage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A year later, in 2003, she appointed high-powered business manager Barry Siegel. It was Siegel who oversaw the 2005 deal in which Lisa Marie sold 85 per cent of her trust’s stake in Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE) for $100 million to entertainment company CKX, plus $25 million of stock in CKX, thereby losing control of the Elvis name, image and likeness. She held on to Graceland and its 13.8 acres, her father’s personal possessions and 15 per cent of EPE.</p><img id=i-3e106b19322fb86 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/20/66801931-11659537-image-a-5_1674247568372.jpg height=472 width=634 alt="Just two days before her death, a frail-looking Lisa Marie sat side-by-side with Priscilla at the Golden Globes and watched 31-year-old Austin Butler win Best Actor for his performance as Elvis" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Just two days before her death, a frail-looking Lisa Marie sat side-by-side with Priscilla at the Golden Globes and watched 31-year-old Austin Butler win Best Actor for his performance as Elvis</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After tax, Lisa Marie walked away with around $40 m from the deal, plus the $25 m of stock. But it didn’t take her long to burn her way through that still sizeable sum.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her finances took a further hit with the 2010 purchase of Coes Hall, a vast 15th-century estate near Rotherfield in East Sussex, purchased for £5.7 million and financed with a loan of £4.3 million from Barclays Bank which was secured against Lisa Marie’s remaining 15 per cent stake in EPE.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She had hoped that the move to England soon after the birth of her twin daughters, would help her turn over a new leaf as she battled opioid addiction. But when her fourth marriage, to musician Michael Lockwood, broke down in 2016, Coes Hall was put on the market.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It finally sold, at a loss, for £3.25 million in 2020, meaning she was still paying off the loan on the property when she died.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2018, Lisa Marie sued Siegel and his company, accusing them of squandering her $100 m inheritance and leaving her with only $14,000 in cash — a sum overshadowed by a $500,000 credit card bill, unpaid taxes and other debts. Siegel hit back claiming she had ‘spent her way into destitution’. Documents show she spent $39million in just four years from 2005 to 2009.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the time of the court action, Siegel released a statement: ‘It’s clear Lisa Marie is going through a difficult time in her life and looking to blame others instead of taking responsibility for her actions.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the case dragged on, it was reported that Priscilla was forced to sell her Los Angeles mansion to help her daughter with her mounting debts.</p><img id=i-e7727c0fce25eb21 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/20/66802021-11659537-image-a-12_1674247855094.jpg height=417 width=306 alt="Elvis famously once flew her in it to Utah so she could play in the snow for just 20 minutes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-e3719e1064871e0e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/20/20/66801941-11659537-image-m-11_1674247848252.jpg height=417 width=306 alt="By the end of the 1980s Graceland was bringing in £15 million a year and, by the time Lisa Marie finally came into her father’s fortune in 1993" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>As a child, Lisa Marie wanted for nothing in material terms.
