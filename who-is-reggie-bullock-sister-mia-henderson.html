She taught me how to take care of the family… She was happy with being who she was. She wasn’t worried about how others felt about her. A person that can isolate the whole world out and not care about other people’s feelings is a strong person, to me. That was one of the biggest things that I got from her.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Who is Reggie Bullock?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Bullock’s real name is Reginald Ryedell Bullock. He is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p><h2><strong>Reggie Bullock bio and career</strong></h2><p>Prior to his professional basketball career, Reggie Bullock showcased his talent and skill on the court as a member of the North Carolina Tar Heels during his college years. In recognition of his abilities, he was chosen by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the 2013 NBA draft, specifically as the 25th overall pick.</p><p>Throughout his career, Bullock has also had the opportunity to play for esteemed teams such as the Phoenix Suns, Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Lakers, and New York Knicks. Bullock’s success in basketball began during his time at Kinston High School, where he led the Kinston High Vikings to three state championship games.</p><p>Remarkably, his team emerged victorious in two of these games, securing championship titles in 2008 and 2010. During the 2010 championship game against West Caldwell, Bullock’s exceptional performance earned him the title of Most Valuable Player, as he contributed a team-high 15 points. His consistent excellence on the court led to his inclusion in the AP All-State men’s team for three consecutive seasons, thanks to his impressive average of 25 points and 11 rebounds per game during the 2009-2010 season.</p><p>In January 2008, Bullock made the decision to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, following a scholarship offer from the Tar Heels. Despite receiving offers from other prestigious institutions such as Maryland, Ohio State, Wake Forest, and Indiana, Bullock’s commitment to the Tar Heels remained unwavering.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The culmination of Bullock’s collegiate career came in 2013 when he was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers as the 25th overall pick in the NBA draft. Shortly after, on July 11, 2013, he signed his first professional contract with the Clippers, marking the beginning of his journey in the NBA. Bullock’s debut in the league took place on October 29, 2013, as he made his first appearance for the Clippers against the Los Angeles Lakers, contributing two points to his team’s efforts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>What happened to Reggie Bullock?</strong></h2><p>The San Antonio Spurs have reached an agreement to waive Reggie Bullock, thereby granting him free agency. Bullock, who was in the final year of a three-year contract, was set to receive a salary of $10.489 million for the current year.</p><p>This decision was reported by Shams Charania. Having showcased his skills as a formidable defender and a reliable three-point shooter during his tenure with the New York Knicks, Bullock subsequently played for the Dallas Mavericks over the past two seasons.</p><p>Notably, he has started in 73% of games over the last three years, including 55 games in the previous season.</p><p>His contributions were instrumental in Dallas’ victory over the Phoenix Suns in the 2022 playoffs. During the summer, Bullock was traded from the Mavericks to the San Antonio Spurs as part of a three-team trade that involved the acquisition of Grant Williams from the Boston Celtics by Dallas.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The San Antonio Spurs and veteran wing Reggie Bullock have agreed to a contract buyout, sources tell <a href=#>@TheAthletic</a> <a href=#>@Stadium</a>.
