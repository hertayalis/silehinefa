The opening lines, "I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, and I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord," express the build-up of anxiety and uncertain anticipation. The lyrics also suggest that the songwriter has been waiting for something significant and unsettling to happen for a long time, and the moment has finally arrived.</p><br><p>The second part of the song expresses the songwriter's personal experience with the person they are addressing, indicating that they have seen through the lies and deceit of this individual. The lines, "Well, if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand, I've seen your face before my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am," expresses the distance between the songwriter and the person they are talking to. The hurt and the pain that the person has caused are affecting the songwriter deeply, and they cannot ignore it.</p><br><p>The use of the refrain "oh Lord" throughout the song also adds an extra layer of emotional depth, suggesting that the songwriter is reaching out for guidance and support from a higher power to overcome the difficult situation they faced. Ultimately, the song drives home the idea that holding onto lies and deceit can lead to severe emotional consequences, and it's better to come out and face the truth.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord</u><br>I have a sense that there's an event that is about to happen soon which could be life-changing or significant, and I am calling on God's guidance and assistance.</p><br><p><u>And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord</u><br>I have been anticipating and preparing for this particular moment or opportunity that could be pivotal to my life, and I am asking for divine help to seize it.</p><br><p><u>Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord</u><br>I am also asking those around me if they sense the same thing that I do, and I am emphasizing the need for divine intervention.</p><br><p><u>Well, if you told me you were drowning</u><br>If you were ever in a perilous situation and sought my help, I would not offer it because you have deceived me before.</p><br><p><u>I would not lend a hand</u><br>I am not willing to assist or offer any form of support because I can't trust your intentions or character.</p><br><p><u>I've seen your face before my friend</u><br>I know who you are, and I'm familiar with your past actions and behaviors.</p><br><p><u>But I don't know if you know who I am</u><br>I don't know if you truly understand my identity, my values, or my motives.</p><br><p><u>Well, I was there and I saw what you did</u><br>I witnessed your actions and deeds firsthand, so I know they were not genuine or trustworthy.</p><br><p><u>I saw it with my own two eyes</u><br>I didn't hear it from someone else or rely on hearsay. I saw your actions clearly, and they were unacceptable.</p><br><p><u>So you can wipe off that grin,</u><br>You shouldn't be smiling or pretending that everything is alright, because I know the truth about you.</p><br><p><u>I know where you've been</u><br>I understand your background, history, and the situations you've been in, which makes me doubt your honesty.</p><br><p><u>It's all been a pack of lies</u><br>Your words, promises, and commitments have always been untrue, and you have misled me multiple times before.</p><br><p><u>I remember, I remember don't worry</u><br>I recall what you've done, and I'm keeping watch, waiting for an opportunity to confront you, but don't be nervous.</p><br><p><u>How could I ever forget,</u><br>What you did had an impact on me, and I cannot erase it from my memory even if I wanted to.</p><br><p><u>It's the first time, the last time we ever met</u><br>The last time we spoke face-to-face was also the first time, and it was memorable because of what you did.</p><br><p><u>But I know the reason why you keep your silence up,</u><br>I understand why you are not open or forthcoming with me, and it's because you don't want to reveal your true motives or actions.</p><br><p><u>No, you don't fool me</u><br>I am not deceived or tricked by your words, actions, or demeanor, and I know your true character.</p><br><p><u>The hurt doesn't show</u><br>You might seem emotionally stable, but you have been affected by your own actions, and it's causing you pain.</p><br><p><u>But the pain still grows</u><br>The more time passes, the more the hurt and pain intensify, and it's not something that you can hide or ignore forever.</p><br><p><u>It's no stranger to you and me</u><br>Both of us are familiar with pain, hurt, and deception, and it's not uncommon for us to experience these negative emotions or actions.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Leah N.
