vent their anger, the very few who still manage to hold their own are greeted as heroes.&nbsp;They may not have done something very spectacular, but when one woman’s action saved the lives of almost a thousand school children, it is nothing short of heroic.&nbsp;Antoinette Tuff is the name of this school worker whose faith and courage prevented the tragedy of a besieged school.</span></p><p><span>In August 2013, where she was working as The Accountant, Tuff, who was still coming to terms with her husband, who had been married for 33 years, had left her, put his best interests aside and his life on the line to talk with a mass murderer, which allowed him to avoid a tragedy.</span></p><p><span>Antoinette Tuff may not have donned a spandex costume but proved in this situation that amazing women don’t just exist on screens but are real people too.&nbsp;Just simple heartfelt words from her, “I love you” to that unarmed would-be shooter and put him down.</span></p><p><span>Here’s everything you need to know about this wonderful woman and her heroism.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Antoinette Tuff</span></strong></h2><p><span>Antoinette Tuff is an American woman who rose to the limelight by simply using love to convince a troubled soul that she cared.&nbsp;She was born in Washington DC, although the details of her birth, including the date, are largely unknown.</span></p><p><span>She fell in love with Terry Tuff, the man who would become her husband, when they were both children.&nbsp;It was a perfect relationship and they loved and loved each other deeply.&nbsp;As adults, they married and had two children, a daughter named LaVita and a son, Derrick.&nbsp;He was born with a neurological disorder that left him legally blind and unable to walk.</span></p><p><span>Thirty-three years into their relationship, the walls crumbled and it all ended in a fleeting second, in 2012. She was devastated and desperate.&nbsp;Tuff was the accountant at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, Atlanta.&nbsp;She was also working to make ends meet, but in the midst of all these activities, she gave up on life and attempted suicide two days before showing such courage in the face of impending evil.&nbsp;She persuaded a suspected gunman, Michael Brandon Hill, to turn himself in in August 2013. His heroic act not only made her famous, but also gave her a new purpose for living.</span></p><h2><strong><span>All you need to know</span></strong></h2><h4><b><span>Tuff used his experiences to successfully convince a gunman</span></b></h4><p><span>Antoinette Tuff Dress Like Everyday on August 20, 2013, and drove to Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, the elementary school where she works as an accountant.&nbsp;However, she was severely depressed and never thought her story would be a turning point in another man’s life, and didn’t talk about the one who was on a killing spree.</span></p><p><span>Tuff was working at reception that day.&nbsp;As she settled into her new position, the door opened and a young armed man entered.&nbsp;Michael Brandon Hill, 20, held a long rifle, an AK-47, with one hand on the barrel and the other on the trigger.&nbsp;He had over 500 rounds of ammunition with him and put the school in jail.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, her heart was beating wildly. A strange calm overcame her.&nbsp;While one of the staff alerted the school to the intruder at her command, Antoinette Tuff took her other orders, including alerting the police to her presence and impending mission;&nbsp;shoot and kill and call a news channel.&nbsp;With the dispatcher online, she spoke with her captor.</span></p><p><span>Then the police arrived and a shootout ensued.&nbsp;Somehow she managed to convince him to come back to the office.&nbsp;With a shoulder injury, Hill came home and by that time he got mellow.&nbsp;At this point, Tuff took control of the situation.&nbsp;She told him her story, her vulnerabilities – divorce, suicide attempt and disabled son, while he himself spoke about his history of mental illness;&nbsp;he has bipolar disease.&nbsp;“It’ll be fine, honey,” Tuff said.&nbsp;“I just want you to know that I love you, okay?&nbsp;And I’m proud of you.&nbsp;Hill put down all his weapons and surrendered to the police.</span></p><p><span>That day, Antoinette Tuff looked death in the eye and did not flinch.&nbsp;His character forced a tragedy to end in peace and no one was hurt.&nbsp;She never imagined becoming a hero, saving over 800 lives and wielding the most powerful weapons of all – love and compassion.&nbsp;Hill pleaded guilty to multiple counts and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</span></p><h4><b><span>She became an instant celebrity</span></b></h4><p><span>Tuff’s life changed forever after the incident.&nbsp;The police came to take her statement, and the news stations also interrogated her.&nbsp;The case, in turn, became the only active school shooting situation in the United States that ended without anyone being killed or injured, including the shooter himself.&nbsp;Now the world knows the accountant.</span></p><p><span>Antoinette Tuff became the bestselling author of her 2014 memoir,&nbsp;</span><span>Prepared for a Purpose</span><span>, an inspirational speaker as well as launched mentoring programs in schools.&nbsp;She was also a guest of Michelle Obama during the FLOTUS era during the State of the Union address.&nbsp;Moreover, she inspires people all over the world to overcome their pain.&nbsp;President Barack Obama also called her directly to thank her for her heroism.</span></p><h4><strong><span>His story was made into a film</span></strong></h4><p><span>The 2018 Lifetime film,&nbsp;</span><span>Faith Under Fire</span><span>, a Bishop T.D. Jakes project told the story of Antoinette Tuff.&nbsp;The film starred Toni Braxton as Tuff and other actors including Yaya Dacosta and Malik Yoba.&nbsp;It was nominated for Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th Academy Awards.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiZnqm8qrrEraueZaSqs6d5waKmoKqRpbW6ecClo2axn6p6r7HEnWStp12gu7DDjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bling-empire-kevin-kreider-responds-scripted-claims.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bling Empire star Kevin Kreider responds to claims the Netflix show is scripted</a>
