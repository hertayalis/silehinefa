– Patrick Mahomes is a professional American football player who has quickly become one of the most recognizable and popular athletes in the world.</strong></p><p>Born on September 17, 1995, in Tyler, Texas, Patrick Mahomes grew up in a family with deep roots in sports. His father, Pat Mahomes, was a Major League Baseball pitcher for 11 seasons, and his godfather, LaTroy Hawkins, also played in the MLB.</p><p>Mahomes attended Whitehouse High School in Texas, where he excelled in multiple sports. He played football, baseball, and basketball, and was a standout athlete in all three. In his senior year, he led the Whitehouse Wildcats football team to a 10-2 record and was named the Texas High School Football Offensive Player of the Year.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Patrick Mahomes committed to play football at Texas Tech University. He redshirted his first year, but in 2015, he became the starting quarterback for the Red Raiders. That season, he threw for 4,653 yards and 36 touchdowns, earning Big 12 Conference Freshman of the Year honors.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Mahomes</a> continued to improve over the next two seasons, putting up eye-popping numbers and establishing himself as one of the top quarterbacks in the country. In his junior year, he threw for 5,052 yards and 41 touchdowns, and was named the 2016 Sammy Baugh Trophy winner as the nation’s top passer. Despite his individual success, however, Texas Tech struggled as a team, finishing with losing records in both of Mahomes’ last two seasons.</p><p>Despite the team’s struggles, Mahomes’ talent was undeniable, and he decided to forego his senior season and enter the NFL draft in 2017. He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs with the 10th overall pick, and many experts saw him as a raw but incredibly talented prospect with a high ceiling.</p><p>Patrick Mahomes spent his rookie season backing up veteran quarterback Alex Smith, but he was given the chance to start in Week 17 when the Chiefs had already clinched a playoff spot. In that game, he threw for 284 yards and a touchdown, showing flashes of the potential that had made him such a highly sought-after prospect.</p><p>In 2018, Mahomes took the league by storm in his first full season as a starter. He threw for 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, becoming just the second quarterback in NFL history to throw for 50 touchdowns in a season. He was named the NFL Most Valuable Player, and led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the New England Patriots in overtime.</p><p>In 2019, Patrick Mahomes continued to dominate, throwing for 4,031 yards and 26 touchdowns in just 14 games. He led the Chiefs to the Super Bowl, where they faced the San Francisco 49ers. In one of the most memorable comebacks in Super Bowl history, Mahomes led the Chiefs back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, throwing two touchdown passes to secure a 31-20 victory. He was named the Super Bowl MVP, and cemented his status as one of the best quarterbacks in the game.</p><p>Off the field, Patrick Mahomes has become a cultural icon, with endorsements from major companies like Adidas, Oakley, and State Farm. He has used his platform to support a variety of charitable causes, including the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation, which he started with his fiancee Brittany Matthews to support youth initiatives in Kansas City.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Super Bowls has Patrick Mahomes been to?</h2><p>Patrick Mahomes has been to three Super Bowls as of March 2023. In his second season as the starting quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, Mahomes led the team to Super Bowl LIV (54) against the San Francisco 49ers on February 2, 2020. The Chiefs came back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win the game 31-20, with Mahomes being named the Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 286 yards and two touchdowns.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In the following season, Mahomes and the Chiefs returned to the Super Bowl, this time facing off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV (55) on February 7, 2021. However, the Chiefs were unable to repeat as champions, falling to the Buccaneers 31-9. Mahomes had a tough game, throwing for 270 yards but failing to throw a touchdown pass while also being sacked three times and throwing two interceptions.</p><p>Despite the loss in Super Bowl LV, Mahomes remains one of the most talented and promising quarterbacks in the NFL. He has already achieved a remarkable amount of success in his young career, including two Super Bowl appearances and one championship, and many expect him to continue to dominate the league for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqGmsGWdlru6edKup56qXZe8uLjSZp%2Baq12lrrW%2ByJyiZqWRnbyusdJmmZ6dnmLBsHs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kylie-jenner-pregnant-baby-instagram-photo.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kylie Jenner Teases She's Pregnant on Instagram with Photo Taken with Travis Scott</a>
