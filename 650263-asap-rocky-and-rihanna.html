Her appearance in the video sparked many of the first rumors that the two were dating.

I actually love to watch cartoons – I've watched like, Teletubbies, Blue's Clues, Yo Gabba Gabba, Peppa Pig and Baby Shark.” He went on, "I hope to raise open-minded children. Not people who discriminate. And I’m not trying to describe a saint, but realistically, I just want a cool child with cool parents."</p><p>A$AP also spoke on his relationship, stating, "I think it’s just natural. We happen to look good together naturally. You know, it would take a lot of work to have us forcefully match before we leave the house. Sometimes we match to a T, or we just wear the same clothes. If I buy a shirt that she likes, I expect to get it stolen… but then I gotta steal it back."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-february-2023-british-vogue-feature>February 2023: British Vogue Feature</h2></span><p>Just days after her <a href=# rel>Super Bowl performance</a>, Rihanna graced the cover of British Vogue with A$AP and their son.
