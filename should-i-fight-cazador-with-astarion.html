Astarion?</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 6 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>Hear this out loud</span><span></span><span>Pause</span><span>With Astarion</span><span> Though it might be tempting to bring Astarion with you for a dramatic showdown with his former master, it is worth noting that <b>if you have Astarion nearby when you approach Cazador, Astarion will lose control and attack Cazador regardless of what dialogue option you choose</b>.</span></p><h2>Is it bad to let Astarion ascend?</h2><p>The Narrative Consequences Of Astarion’s Ascension</p><p>Despite being vocally grateful to you, he will quickly become much more arrogant and power-hungry, even noting in the following conversation his desire to subjugate the world, now that he has obtained this power.</p><h2>Should you let Astarion feed on you?</h2><p>If you plan to make Astarion a permanent part of your party, you should consider letting him suck your blood for the Happy buff. This buff will add a +1 to all his checks. He will also permanently gain the Vampire Bite action in battle.</p><h2>What happens if you don’t take Astarion?</h2><p>Simply put, nothing happens if you ignore Astarion. If you walk away from his offer or simply never approach him to begin with, you can always find Astarion in the same spot on the beach, even after you leave for Act 2 without him.</p><h2>What did Cazador do to Astarion?</h2><p>Astarion and Cazador knew each other. Astarion tried to manipulate Cazador but Cazador took notice and decided to teach Astarion a harsh lesson. He uses the Gur to bring Astarion to his lowest point, make him desperate enough to want to accept his offer to become a vampire spawn.</p><h2>Astarion & Cazador: All 4 Choices, Outcomes, & Endings | Baldur’s Gate 3 (BG3)</h2><h2>Does Astarion have a good ending?</h2><p>Despite gaining freedom from Cazador’s control and stopping a deadly ritual, the morally good ending for Astarion doesn’t give him true freedom. The only difference in his life is not being controlled, but he mentions that being able to stand in the sun was nice while it lasted, giving his ending a melancholic feeling.</p><h2>Can Cazador kidnap Astarion?</h2><p>Do note that there’s a camp event at night where some of Cazador’s thralls attempt to kidnap Astarion, and you’ll have no choice but to defeat them. The thralls that you defeat will simply vanish, though we don’t know if this event has any bearing in the upcoming battle.</p><h2>Does Astarion break up with you?</h2><p>Players can pick whichever option they feel suits how they want their relationship with Astarion to be. Picking options that manipulate Astarion into having sex with you simply for pleasure will be followed by a cutscene where Astarion breaks up with the player.</p><h2>Can you romance Astarion?</h2><p>Before you can get a chance with Astarion for a romance scene, you’ll need to make some progress in Baldur’s Gate 3. Also, it’s extremely important to try and make your decisions with his approval in mind.</p><h2>Can you romance Astarion later in the game?</h2><p>If his approval rating of you is high enough by the time you celebrate at the camp after the Save the Refugees side-quest, you’ll be able to continue your flirtationship with him at that time. To successfully romance Astarion at the camp, you’ll need to select the following dialogue prompts: Really?</p><h2>Should I let Astarion turn me into a vampire?</h2><p>There is indeed the risk of death, but the risk is small, and the player character can still be revived if Astarion inadvertently kills them. The benefits of letting Astarion bite the player character greatly outweigh the risks, so there’s no reason not to let him go ahead with it.</p><h2>Should you give Astarion the parasite?</h2><p>Should you give Astarion the parasite? For the most part, you are safe to consume these normal parasites as you please. The only negative here is many companions, minus Astarion, will dislike you doing this each time.</p><h2>Should you ask Astarion about his scars?</h2><p>Apparently, you should always ask Astarion about his scar for the scar-reading scene to appear.</p><h2>Should you release Cazador’s spawn?</h2><p>Remain Indifferent. Besides killing or rescuing, players can also choose to just leave the spawn. If this option is chosen, Astarion will break the staff, making it impossible to free the vampire spawn or perform any rituals in the future.</p><h2>How do you get Astarion to like you without being evil?</h2><p>Mainly the things he seems to like (aside from obviously evil things) are being pragmatic and not taking crap from others (literally in the case of some goblins). It also helps immensely if you let him feed from you, compliment him, and trust him with the Book of Thay.</p><h2>What does Astarion desire more than anything?</h2><p>Personal survival and self-interest. He thinks about his survival above all else, as well as freedom against Cazador, the vampire he served under. The Tadpdole that the Mind Flayers implanted in Astarion’s brain nullified his various Vampiric Banes. As such, he has an extreme attachment to it.</p><h2>Can you romance Astarion if you dont sleep with him in Act 1?</h2><p>Re: Do I have to sleep with Astarion during the party to begin romancing him? You don’t need to sleep with him at the party! If you get his approval high enough, he’ll proposition you on his own at some point during act 1 when you talk to him.</p><h2>Why can Astarion be in sunlight?</h2><p>Because Astarion is a vampire whose depiction matches that of many popular vampires, he would burn if exposed to sunlight. Due to the Mind Flayer tadpole’s effects on his body, this is no longer the case as he can safely travel alongside the party during the daylight hours.</p><h2>How old is Astarion?</h2><p>Based on my understanding, Shadowheart appears to be around 40 years old, Laezel seems to be in the range of 18-21 (excluding dimensional influences), Gale’s age is likely over 30, and Astarion’s age might be over 200 years old, possibly around 240-250 , considering elven aging.</p><h2>Do I give Astarion blood?</h2><p>So long as Astarion drinks any blood at all, he’ll get the inverse, a +1 buff to attack rolls and ability checks for one day. Switch party members and use him until the next long rest to make good use of this. Those who don’t like Astarion can banish him from the group or kill him.</p><h2>Can I romance Karlach and Astarion?</h2><p>While Karlach is incapable of being in a physically intimate relationship with players, she is open to players having intimate relationships with others. This is most likely to be Astarion, as the other polyamorous romance option, Halsin, is not available until later.</p><h2>Can you romance Astarion in Act 3?</h2><p>There’s a romance trigger AT Cazador quest. If he’s being cheeky with you, he like likes you. Be cheeky back.</p><h2>How do I stop Astarion?</h2><p>How do I handle Astarion?</p><li>Talk to the spawn in the cages before you enter the main hall.</li><li>After defeating Cazador, tell Astarion either that he shouldn’t do the ritual because it will kill all the spawn in the cages or tell him that the ritual will consume him.</li><h2>When should I go to Cazador?</h2><p>Once you speak to the two thralls in Baldur’s Gate 3 from the Flophouse, you’ll discover that Cazador’s Palace lies in the Lower City, an area you can only access in Act 3.</p><h2>How to survive Cazadores?</h2><p>Always, always aim for the wings. You only need to disable one wing to FORCE cazadores to ground. Their movement speed will decrease significantly, leaving them vulnerable. It makes them much easier to hit and far easier to avoid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5wv8eorKWcXZ56p7XGoatmm5GvrqW70WauoqyYYq60wMCroKimXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./9-teens-escape-from-the-pennsylvania-juvenile-detention-center-abraxas-academy-after-riot-police.html>&#171;&nbsp;9 teens escape from the Pennsylvania juvenile detention center, Abraxas Academy, after riot: police</a>
