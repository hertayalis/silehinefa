The opening line, "She don't want me to leave her, but I do bad all by myself," suggests that he recognizes the toxic nature of his relationships but ultimately chooses to prioritize his own well-being. He acknowledges that he has the power to touch people's souls through his music, symbolized by the key hanging from his belt, indicating his influence and success.</p><br><p>The lyrics also touch upon LUCKI's addiction to lean, a mixture of cough syrup and soda, which he highlights as an expensive habit. He mentions how a pretty girl is scared of him when she sees him asleep, implying that his drug use affects his appearance and behavior. Despite the references to his addiction, he acknowledges that he saves his life by using Jeeps, possibly referring to seeking solace or escape through driving.</p><br><p>There are references to the opinions and criticisms he receives from others, particularly the perception that he glorifies drug use. In response, LUCKI asserts that he is not responsible for the choices of others and dismisses them as jokes. He humorously mentions laughing all the way to the bank while spending money on expensive drinks and accessories.</p><br><p>Overall, "Leave Her" delves into LUCKI's complex relationships, his reflection on his own behavior, and his ability to impact others through his music. It suggests that he is aware of his personal struggles and is willing to prioritize his own well-being despite the desire of others to keep him close.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean

for me to stay by her side.</p><br><p><u>But I do bad all by myself</u><br>However, I find solace and navigate through difficult situations without her.</p><br><p><u>Touch they soul, they gave me the key</u><br>When I connect with others on a deeper level, they grant me access and trust.</p><br><p><u>I got 'em hangin' from my belt</u><br>I have a significant influence over them, making them depend on me.</p><br><p><u>Being a lean addict ain't so cheap</u><br>The addiction to lean comes at a great cost.</p><br><p><u>Pretty girl scared when she see me sleep</u><br>Attractive women become frightened when they witness my vulnerable state of sleep.</p><br><p><u>All of my raps I talk about tracks</u><br>I often discuss my music and the industry in my lyrics.</p><br><p><u>But I be saving my life in these Jeeps, hm</u><br>However, it is these cars, specifically Jeeps, that have provided me with a sense of safety and escapism.</p><br><p><u>Ayy told her, "You don't know me either"</u><br>I expressed to her that she lacks a true understanding of who I am.</p><br><p><u>"But Tune, you be speaking your soul through music"</u><br>"But, dear Tune, you genuinely express your deepest emotions through your music."</p><br><p><u>"Niggas be getting high all 'cause of you"</u><br>"Individuals find solace in drug use solely because of your influence."</p><br><p><u>"You ain't even want that type of influence"</u><br>"Yet, you never desired to possess that level of impact on others."</p><br><p><u>Niggas be jokes, I'ma laugh to the bank</u><br>People often underestimate me, but I find amusement in their foolishness as I prosper financially.</p><br><p><u>I'ma spend your cheap-ass chain on drank</u><br>I have no qualms about using the money I earn to purchase expensive alcohol, even if it exceeds the value of someone's inexpensive jewelry.</p><br><p><u>Cartier frames gon' hide my high</u><br>Wearing Cartier glasses allows me to conceal the intoxication I experience.</p><br><p><u>G63 got me feeling like Faith</u><br>Driving a Mercedes G63 makes me feel powerful and confident, akin to Faith Evans' persona.</p><br><p><u>I drove a hot Hellcat to Detroit</u><br>I confidently drove a fast Hellcat automobile to the city of Detroit.</p><br><p><u>East side bitch say she see it everyday</u><br>A woman from the east side claims to witness my success and lifestyle on a regular basis.</p><br><p><u>Chicago bitch don't let me get high</u><br>A woman from Chicago discourages and tries to prevent me from indulging in drugs.</p><br><p><u>Well, you need to stay your ass out of LA</u><br>In response, I suggest that she should refrain from visiting Los Angeles to avoid interfering with my choices.</p><br><p><u>Perks in the new whip</u><br>I possess and consume prescription drugs inside my recently acquired car.</p><br><p><u>We ain't goin' on dates</u><br>Our relationship does not involve traditional romantic outings.</p><br><p><u>I'm in Magic City with the racks, not a cape</u><br>I frequent Magic City strip club and display a significant amount of money, symbolizing my wealth and power instead of wearing a superhero cape.</p><br><p><u>Almighty So a bitch, blew my high</u><br>Even though I consider myself powerful, someone managed to ruin my good mood.</p><br><p><u>Folks get money off road like a range</u><br>Individuals earn a substantial income through illegal activities such as drug trafficking, similar to driving a Range Rover off-road.</p><br><p><u>Where all this money gon' go if I die?</u><br>I ponder the destination of my wealth in the event of my death.</p><br><p><u>This bitch think her Percs is safe</u><br>A woman believes her prescription pills are secure and protected.</p><br><p><u>Almighty So a bitch blew my high</u><br>My powerful persona was undermined, and I no longer feel euphoric.</p><br><p><u>I got a few more yerks anyway</u><br>Regardless, I still possess a few more hits of drugs.</p><br><p><u>Touch they soul, they give me the key</u><br>By deeply connecting with others, they grant me access, trust, and influence.</p><br><p><u>She don't want me to leave her</u><br>Despite her resistance, she desires for me to stay by her side.</p><br><p><u>But I do bad all by myself</u><br>However, I find solace and navigate through difficult situations without her.</p><br><p><u>Touch they soul, they give me the key</u><br>When I connect with others on a deeper level, they grant me access and trust.</p><br><p><u>Touch they soul, they give me the

me the key</u><br>When I connect with others on a deeper level, they grant me access and trust.</p><br><p><u>I got it hangin' from my belt</u><br>I have the key hanging from my belt, signifying the control and influence I possess.</p><br><p><u>She don't want me to leave her</u><br>Despite her resistance, she desires for me to stay by her side.</p><br><p><u>Whoa, whoa, ayy</u><br>A sound of surprise, excitement, or affirmation.</p><br><p><u>Ayy, she don't want me to leave her</u><br>She strongly opposes the idea of me departing from her life.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics ©
