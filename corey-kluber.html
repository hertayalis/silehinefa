He entered the big league, i.e., MLB, in 2011 and is currently a pitcher for the <strong>Boston Red Sox</strong>. He has previously played for Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, New York Yankees, and Tampa Bay Rays.</p><p>The Stetson Athletics and Athletic Sun Conference Hall of Famer, Kuber was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on <strong>April 10, 1986</strong>. His zodiac sign is Aries.</p><h2>Who Is Corey Kluber Wife?</h2><p>Corey Kluber has found the love of his life, and that woman is Amanda Kluber. This lovely couple got married in <strong>2010 </strong>in a private ceremony. Kluber doesn't shy away from showing his love towards her on the internet, as evident with all his pictures with her on his Insta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/2/271580783_642636843827635_7865968417546258583_n%20(1)-1672645283139.jpg><p>On the other hand, Amanda Kluber&nbsp;is just the opposite of the <i>Red Sox pitcher</i> Kluber in case of revealing her personal life info. It is because her insta account is not open for everyone to see and generally isn't around much in the media.&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda had <strong>known </strong>Kluber before he even played in MLB, which is evident from their marriage date. But one more thing you need to know about their relationship is that they have been in touch since college. It is stated that these two <strong>met each</strong> other at Stetson University.</p><h2>How Much Kluber Made Playing Baseball?</h2><p>Corey Kluber's MLB career has been going on for a decade, and he started playing baseball way before that. His success on the ball field has translated into good monetary success since his estimated net worth stands at around <strong>$12 Million</strong>.</p><p>There will also be some commercial aspects when you are involved in big sports like Baseball. Besides his regular salary, he also makes money through clothing and merchandise sales through Fan Arch.</p><p>Kluber is one of the top-valued athletes in the league, and it shows with the amount he gets paid to play. The pitcher is an athlete for Boston Red Sox, who, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Spotrac</i></a>, is on a one-year contract at the club that will pay him <strong>$10 Million</strong>. Remember that he is thirty-six years old, and he is still able to pull this much money.</p><h2>Kluber Is Fathering Three Children&nbsp;</h2><p>Kluber loves two things when he isn't on the ball field: spending quality time with his family and playing golf. He not only has the responsibility of being a good husband for Amanda but also being a good father to the three kids he shares with her. <strong>Kendall, Kennedy, </strong>and<strong> Camden </strong>are his children.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/2/64210243_141905620214507_1151853599100811950_n%20(1)-1672645449403.jpg><p>The kids have been kept away from the limelight, and there isn't much known about them apart from a few pictures that Kluber has with his kids on his Insta. Their birth date is yet to be discovered, but one thing that is known is that his youngest child is Kennedy.</p><h2>Physical Attributes</h2><p>Baseball is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world. You have to work on your entire body in the field. To have a successful career, you need to be built well, and Corey Kluber is a well-built athlete, as evidenced by his body measurements.</p><p>He can even give competition to some NBA players when it comes to height, as the pitcher has the same height as <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kevin Csolak</a> at <strong>6 Feet 4 Inches</strong> (193 cm). It would be best if you worked on a lot of your muscles while playing this sport which will give you a lot of body weight. Kluber works on it, evidenced by his body weight of <strong>215 lbs</strong> (98 kg).</p><h2>Kluber Is A Student From Stetson University</h2><p>College sports are highly regarded in the United States; if you do well there, you will make it to the big leagues. Kluber was at Stetson University (the same University journalist <a href=# rel=nofollow>Britt Mchenry</a> also studied at) for three years. The fact that he is a Stetson Athletics Hall of Famer can give you an idea of how good he was during his time there. He studied <strong>Sports Management</strong> during his time over there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/2/BPEBOLRYFTMUMKS.20070602220407%20(1)-1672645651453.jpg><p>But his baseball story had started even before he joined Stetson. He was already performing brilliantly at Coppell High School. According to Stetson Hatters website, he was two times all-district performer at High School, also playing a crucial part in their district championship victory in <strong>2002</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Has Supportive Parents</h2><p>Kluber is blessed to have a mom and dad who have supported him throughout his baseball career. He is the son of <strong>Ellen Kluber</strong> and <strong>Jim Kluber</strong>. It is important to have a good father-son relationship, and Kulber shares that with Jim, mostly on the golf course, as they both love playing golf.&nbsp;</p><p>Kluber's father is a huge Baseball fan and, more importantly, supports Cleveland Indians. You don't need to imagine how proud he must have felt when his son joined the club, as Jim had made it very clear when that happened. <i>The Morning Journal </i>has reported what happened the day Kluber broke the news to his parents.</p><p>Jim Kluber, while recalling the incident, said:</p><p>I remember the day he got traded to the Indians. He called us and said, ‘Guess what? I got traded to Cleveland.’ I started laughing because I thought he was kidding. Then he said, ‘No, really. I got traded to the Indians.’ My wife and I went crazy.</p><h2>Career And Achievements</h2><p>Corey Kluber has been in MLB since <strong>2011</strong> and has achieved a lot of success on the field. He has a good reputation for his injuries, which affects his performance. His achievements are still pretty impressive, considering that.</p><p>His current record is <strong>113</strong> wins and <strong>71</strong> losses, and his earned run average (ERA) is <strong>3.31</strong>. As per stats published on <a href=# rel=nofollow>MLB's</a> official website, in 2022 alone, his win rate hasn't been the best as he is currently on ten wins and ten losses, but his ERA is <strong>4.34</strong>, and his IP of <strong>164.0</strong>. The pitcher has<strong> 1683 </strong>strikeouts in his career.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Kluber's&nbsp;time at Cleveland Indians was impressive, as he won two '<strong>Cy Young Awards</strong>.' He won his first one in <strong>2014</strong> and the second one in <strong>2017</strong>.</p><h2>Kluber&nbsp;Was Accused Of Cheating: But Why?</h2><p>Kluber's legacy was affected because of an allegation that he cheated while playing for the Indians. It was the infamous <strong>Brian Harkins</strong> who brought this up. The former Indians pitcher was alleged of doing one of the most common ways of cheating in Baseball, ball doctoring.</p><p>Harkins used to work as a clubhouse manager for LA Angels until he was found to be providing players with the sticky substances they could use for ball doctoring. He had revealed a few names to whom he used to provide it; one of them was Kluber. It remains to be proven whether the allegations are true or not.</p><p><i><strong>Do consider checking out</strong> </i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>MarriedCeleb</i></a><i> <strong>if you are looking for more exciting celebrity bios</strong>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpymq52pYritwcGeqQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-unlock-the-duality-dungeon-in-destiny-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;How to unlock the Duality Dungeon in Destiny 2</a>
